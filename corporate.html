                </li></ul>
                  <em>•	Red is a strong hue that frequently connotes intensity, emotion, and energy—elements that are in perfect harmony with the essence of hard rock music. Red can arouse in fans the intense emotion and energy associated with the genre. Because it draws the eye, this color is appropriate for a company that wishes to come across as daring and memorable.

                    &hellip;</em> 
                <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #36312E;"></span>
                  #36312E
                </li>
                </ul>
                  <em>•	Since dark grey is a strong and authoritative color, it could be interpreted as a representation of the firm foundation hard rock music has had throughout music history. Because of its versatility, it can be used to ground branding while allowing for an edge that is very much in keeping with hard rock aesthetics. It may also be readily matched with more brilliant hues. Moreover, dark grey gives the possibility to have a bolder design, making space for bolder colors such as red and yellow. As the genre of rock is always displayed within the colors of strong red and grey or black, this color palette is suitable for Amplify as a brand and for its target audience. &hellip;</em>
                <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFCD29;"></span>
                  #FFCD29</li></ul>
                  <em>•	Yellow is used as an accent color to offer an intense touch that draws attention without overpowering the main color scheme. Yellow can stand for the strong energy and bursts of excitement that are connected to electric guitar solos and live performances in the hard rock genre. It's a color that, with its brightness, can energize a brand identity and inspire passion.&hellip;</em>
                
                  <ul>
                <li>

                  #B18DD4</li> </ul>
                  <em>•	A sense of mystery and intricacy can be conveyed by Purple, which is evocative of the depth and occasionally the cryptic or gloomy lyrics present in hard rock music. Due to its historical associations with monarchy and wealth, this hue may lend the brand an air of exclusivity and appeal to fans who value their musical preferences highly and regard them as essential components of who they are. In combination with yellow, being a vibrant, bright, and warm color, using it as an accent against purple produces a striking contrast.&hellip;</em>

            <li class="rock-salt-font">•Rock Salt</li>
            <li>With its handcrafted appearance and bold presence, Rock Salt may evoke the rebellious and raw spirit of rock culture. Fans may find it reminiscent of vintage band logos and album covers, which are frequently customized and possess a distinctive style.	</li>
            
           
            <li class="archivo-font">•Archivo</li>
            <li>Archivo Normal is used as a body font and it is a legible, more solemn typeface that works well for body writing. For readers to explore and absorb information with ease, the body font needs to be comprehensible even though the headlines are more ostentatious and complement rock's expressive style. Without drawing attention to itself, Tauri's modern, minimalistic line counterbalances the more flashy header fonts. </li>
            
            
            <li>The typeface used for the header is Archivo 700 Bold. To emphasize the difference between the body font and the header, all of the headings are written in capital letters. To allow for a more artistic approach regarding the visuals, we used the same typeface in different styles. However, the fonts are more relaxed to make it easier on the eyes. As a result, the strength remains in the visuals and graphics, while the simpler fonts provide a better balance.</li>

            <h5><b>The structure of the navigation and content</b></h5>
            <em>The navigation Is designed in order to not be too harsh on the eye. The content on the pages is distributed in a balanced way: if a section presents more colors, text or pictures, the second section that follows after is more light, and not too crowded, in order for the user to not get overwhelmed by the amount of information or design. The colors give the user a funk experience. The information is placed in the middle, in order to be readable for the user and to not miss it. Clear navigation and a logical Information Architecture ensure the user can intuitively browse the website without confusion. This includes a clear hierarchy, easy-to-understand menu labels, and a search function, all of which contribute to a positive user experience by minimizing effort and frustration.</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            <em><b>1.	Navigation Bar</b>
              -	The design of the navigation bar is bold, and simple, especially used for a user-friendly experience, especially when the content and layout of the pages emerge colors and richness in content. Moreover, the navigation bar is sticky, which provides the user with easiness of navigation, allowing the user to navigate through other pages without having to scroll back to the top. 
            </em>
            <ul>
            <li>- A search bar is incorporated directly into the navigation bar, which supports autonomy, which is another element that provides the user with easy navigation, because the user can search freely the exact content that he wants, without having to scroll through the pages to find it, fitting with a user-centric design ethos. The search is time-effective, being a quicker option for the user to get the information it needs. </li>

           <br>
           <em><b>2.	Image and Text Layout and colors</b>
            -	For the “product features” on the landing page section, the dynamic use of presenting information through content and images provides the user with the feeling of a concert experience, mirroring it to the back-and-forth rhythm. Moreover, the layout caters to the F-pattern reading style of web users, the information being placed in areas where viewrs naturally begin to scan the pages.

            <li>- The purple gradient background creates a different and magic experience for the user , which is memorable, reinforcing brand recognition. </li>

           <br>
           <em><b>3.	Call-to-action buttons:</b>
            -	The buttons are strategically placed, serving as a strong call to action, aligning also with our marketing goals, providing awareness, and increasing app downloads as well as reach. The buttons have the same design, red in the beginning and when clicked, they turn into yellow. Red is a strong color that drags the user’s attention to the call-to-action, and yellow is the accent color that makes it important.
            </em>
            <ul>
            <li>- “Click to find out about our app” button, when clicked, it runs the user to the section where it can check and find information about the features that our app provides, instead of having to scroll down. It gives a more dynamic and interactive touch. </li>
            <li>- The buttons that lead the user to download the app are strong call to action, visible and straightforward in order to push the user to get our product: the app. In this way, it is more accessible, quicker, which makes the user and the navigation effective for the user, not having to search for the app in order to download it: we give to the user the exact action to do so on the website. 
            </li>
            <li> - CTAs are strategically placed and designed with red background BUT yellow highlights to guide and take the attention of the the user towards the marketing strategy’s objectives. The design of these elements is critical—they stand out but not overpower the overall design.</li>

            <br>
            <em> <b>4.	Footer</b>

Bright calls to action and interactive features, such as social media connections, involve people immediately and create a feeling of community and involvement similar to attending a concert in person.

The monochrome aesthetic of the photographs against the stark, contrasting background aligns with the genre’s traditional visuals, while the splashes of brighter colors in the text and highlights bring focus to key information and maintain the user’s attention as the carousel transitions, providing a visual rhythm that echoes the pulsing beats of rock music.</li>

                                      <li>Have an option to control the carousel with the photos and text about each team member yourself</li>
                                      <li>Make the text ‘’check out our social media’’ and the social media logos bigger and closer to each other.</li>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="heading-corporate-1">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Amplify is a brand that strives to connect rock fans through concerts and amplify their experience. We are a service that offers rock fans the chance to connect with other rock fans alike them and go to concerts around The Netherlands. From the conducted interviews with our target audience we found out that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>rock fans don’t have people to go to concerts with</li>
            <li>It is hard for rock fans to find people to go to concerts with and they don’t know where to look</li>
            <li>They want to meet new people in general</li>
            <li>They want to have new experiences </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="em-spacing1">Social Media choice</h5>
            <p>Target audience is hard rock fans aged between 18-30, who are hard rock listeners and open to listen to different sub-genres of rock, they enjoy the rush of attending concerts more than once a year.  Instagram is the most used platform by people aged 18-34. They make up 61 % of all Instagram users (Zote,2024). From the conducted interviews all 8 of our interviewees use Instagram as their preferred platform. Some of them use Reddit and just 1 has Facebook,  which he hasn’t opened in months , so we decided not to focus on Facebook and choose only Instagram.
            </p>
            <h5 class="em-spacing1">Objectives</h5>
            <h6 class="em-spacing">1. Reach</h6>
            
           <ul><li><b>Reach 500 accounts through “accounts reached” by March 31st, 2024.</b> </li></ul> 
<em>            When individuals encounter a brand for the first time, they already have an idea of the brand visibility, reputation, and its message (Edelman, 2023). Therefore, trust is necessary. In this context, 500 accounts reached will give the confidence to other individuals to trust and visit the social media page.
</em>             
             <ul><li><b>An average watch time of 4 seconds per reel by March 31st, 2024</b></li></ul> 
              <em>The average watch time of Instagram reels is 3-4 seconds( Temples,2024)
              </em>                
                <ul><li><b>Average of 250 views per reel shared on Instagram by March 31st, 2024</b> </li></ul>
               <em>The most reached followers per reel for an account up to 500 followers was 288 in 2023, so we think it would be realistic to say that we want to have an average of 250 views per shared reel.
              </em>                 
            <h6 class="em-spacing">2. Affect</h6> 
           <ul><li><b>We want our audience to feel excited and engaged by March 31st, through engagement in posts by turning on countdown reminders and notifications, interacting on polls, quiz, questions and direct messages.</b>
            </li></ul> 
            <em>Social media engagement is found to have a great impact on small businesses affecting especially the customer loyalty (Read, 2020).Research also found that 63% of consumers agree that their loyalty to a brand is influenced by the quality of customer service provided on social media (Social media’s role, n.d.)
            </em>
            <h6 class="em-spacing">3. Advocacy response </h6>
            <ul><li class="bold-marketing">Have at least one share per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.</li></ul>
            <p>If people share the social media content that the brand is creating it can start a sense of trust and quality, because people sometimes see popular content as investigated and approved by others (Agency Analytics, n.d.)</p>
            <ul><li class="bold-marketing">Reach a minimum of 1 comment on each Instagram post by March 31st, 2024.
            </li></ul>
           <p>Furthermore, a research conducted with 123,410 Instagram profiles shows that profiles with up to 1000 followers only get 1 comment per post maximum on a day (Bieldfeldt, 2021).
          </p>
          <ul><li class="bold-marketing">Hit at least 10 to 15 likes per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.
          </li></ul>
          <p>The aforementioned research conducted by Bielfeldt (2021) and Erxleben (2021) both mention that small Instagram accounts up to 1000 followers get a max of 5 likes per day.
          </p>
         <ul> <li class="bold-marketing">Have 20 clicks of the link in our bio by March 31st
          </li></ul>
          <p>The link in the bio will be used to send the audience to the website and therefore  they will be directed to more business focused content which increases brand presence (Fuhrmann Creative; LLC, 2023, August 23).
          </p>
          <h5 class="em-spacing1">Campaign</h5>
          <p class="bold-marketing">For our media campaign we use Instagram as a social media platform to promote the brand. </p>
          <p class="bold-marketing">With our campaign we want our target audience to get familiar with our brand and feel being part of our hard rock fans community. We also want to spread awareness about our app. </p>
          <ul><li>We introduced our brand, shared our values and vision in a post. To help  us achieve our Affect objective, because it made our audience feel excited about our brand, create a sense of loyalty. Sharing our values also help us attract customers that share the same values.
          </li>
          <li>Countdown stories - to achieve our Affect objective, because audience will feel engaged by turning on countdowns for our launches
          </li>
          <li>Reels - we shared behind the scenes reels to achieve our Reach objectives. We also shared our reels on stories with interactive questions about them so the audience can engage with them more.We also introduced our team in individual reels for each person. 
          </li>
          <li>Posts with information about our service and our app. These posts help us build trust in our brand, build excitement as well. They promote our brand and our service.We shared main features of the app to keep the audience engaged for the launch of the product. We also shared these posts in stories for further engagement and word of mouth recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>For all posts and reels we used detailed and longer captions to keep the attention of the viewer to help with engagement. We also added hashtags to all posts and reels to make them more discoverable.

            </p>
            <ul><li class="bold-marketing">Remade content calendar:</li></ul>
            <p>This is how our content calendar looks after the changes in time for posting and some new content ideas. We also spread out the reels posting to ensure more engagement. We added more posts that share information about our website and about our app to help promote our brand. We also added more stories with interactive polls and questions to make our audience engage more with our brand.</p>
          
            <h4 id="marketing-2" class="heading-corporate-1 em-spacing1">Learning Points</h4>
            <p class="bold-marketing em-spacing1">Reach
            </p>
           <ul><li>Reach 500 accounts through “accounts reached” by March 31st, 2024.- We reached this objective, even exceeded with almost a 1000 more accounts. We didn’t expect to achieve this objective, we actually thought that 500 accounts is too much to reach in 4 weeks.

            </div>
           <ul> <li>An average watch time of 4 seconds per reel by March 31st, 2024- All of our reels are 5 seconds or longer, so we thought that 4 seconds average watch time would be achievable, because most people don’t watch reels until the end. We managed to achieve this objective for 4 out of 5 reels. We didn’t reach this objective on our most watched reel (1451 views), so we think that this reel had a strong hook, but could not captivate the attention of the viewers for any longer, so the reel is lacking something in the middle- adding more value, element of a surprise, call to action or highlight the benefit of watching until the end.

            <ul><li>Average of 250 views per reel shared on Instagram by March 31st, 2024- During the first two weeks we had posted three reels all with under 200 views. We thought that we would not reach this objective during the last two weeks. But then one of the reels gained over a 1000 views, therefore all other reels also received engagement and went over 250 views. This was also the reel with the strongest hook, so we learned that reels with stronger hooks and longer captions receive more views. FFor this reel we also used a trendy instagram sound which we think is key for the engagement on this reel.

            <ul><li>We want our audience to feel excited and engaged by March 31st, through engagement in posts by turning on countdown reminders and notifications, interacting on polls, quiz, questions and direct messages. - We believe that for 4 weeks we have built a small but strong community that believes in our brand. We posted a lot of stories with interactive polls, questions and our followers were very active on those polls. We also received a few direct messages and we tried to respond in less than an hour. In those direct messages we also received positive feedback on the look of our feed and our values as well, which we believe shows that we have built some sense of trust and loyalty in our followers. We learned that interactive stories are a great way to interact with our followers and to open discussions in direct messages so we will continue to make them and more often.
            </li></ul>
            <p class="bold-marketing em-spacing1">Advocacy response
            </p>
            <ul><li>Have at least one share per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.- We managed to reach this objective, all of our posts have been shared once by different people on their stories. Even though we reached this objective, we were hoping for more shares. We learned that longer captions with more value and information will be more beneficial for people to spread the word for our reels, so they share this information with others.
            </li>
            <li>Reach a minimum of 1 comment on each Instagram post by March 31st, 2024.- We reached this objective on a few of our posts. We were expecting to reach it and even exceed it. We learned that a call to action in the caption, or adding a question in the caption that viewers can answer in the comments and start a discussion, will bring us more comments on our posts.</li>
            <li>Hit at least 10 to 15 likes per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.- We managed to reach this objective as expected. We learned that building trust and loyalty in our audience builds a stronger community , therefore consistency in our engagement on posts and reels.
            </li>
            <li>Have 20 clicks of the link in our bio by March 31st- We almost reached this objective. We believe that we didn’t reach it because we shared the link to our website too late. We also could have posted it on our stories with a call to action to view our website to receive more traffic.
            </li></ul>
            <p class="em-spacing1"> <i>Overall we learned that a well made and prepared Content calendar is the key to a successful campaign. We managed to post everything planned in the Content calendar, because with it you can see what you have to prepare for next week. It removed the stress from creating the content last minute or forgetting to post. Midway during our campaign we scheduled our content on the Instagram app itself (Instagram provides this feature to “pre-post”) so we got a reminder every time, you just click and post, this also helped to not forget to post. This was especially helpful to post at exactly 6pm, because this is the time we received the most engagement, after testing other posting times. We learned that reels should have strong hooks and some element of value or surprise in the middle to keep the viewer’s attention until the end. We learned that asking questions in the captions of our reels and posts will help open discussions in the comments. We received the most engagement with our profile through reels, so we learned that we should focus on them. We also learned that interactive stories are very helpful with interacting with our audience, which builds trust and loyalty. </i></p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="heading-corporate-1">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we continue the campaign in the future, we will first set new objectives, so that we have clear goals and the content we make aims to reach those objectives. We will also make a new Content calendar, because it helped  us a lot during those four weeks. It removed the stress from forgetting when to post and what to post, brainstorming and planning the content ahead helped us save more time on thinking during the campaign and gave us time to interact with our audience and be more active on stories. In the future we will focus on reels, because they brought the most traffic to our page, but we will use more trendy instagram sounds so they reach more people. We will also make reels have strong hooks and more information both in the video and in the caption, because our best performing reel had both of those. For posts we will add questions that the audience can answer in the comments for further engagement and start discussions. We will post more stories with interactive questions, polls. We want to interact more with our audience so we build trust and loyalty. In the future we would also want to have posts or reels in collaboration with influencers or hard rock bands for some giveaway.  We found that giveaways bring a lot of engagement to profiles. We posted our website link too late and with no previous announcement so in the future, when there are new changes in our website or app, we will notify the audience that changes will be made or that there will be new announcements( like the giveaways) so we build anticipation in our audience and further engagement.</p>

          <p>For our Instagram posts we use our three primary colors- red, dark gray and purple. We also add a lighting bolt which is a symbol of our brand (also in the logo) and a guitar to also amplify that our brand is connected to rock. We used a different font from the one on our website, because this is more readable when the background is one of our bright colors, it is also more bold.</p>

          <h4>Problem:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Out of all the interviews we did, which were 10 in total, these 4 problems were the most prevalent in all of them. Some we already knew, others not, but for all of them it became more clear that they pose a real problem within the hard rock community.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Existing Alternatives:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Social Media: It is used a lot for connecting especially Discord, Reddit, Facebook groups and Instagram can be used to directly (video) chat with people.</li>
          <li>Tinder Festival Mode: Tinder has a feature called Tinder Festival Mode on which people can match who are going to the same festival or who have a love for live music</li>
          <li>Appic: an app which can be used to find festivals, parties and clubs in the Netherlands and Belgium. </li>
          <li>Songkicl:  an app on which people can find concerts of Warner Music Group.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Solution:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Benefit: The app  has kind of the same way of working as Tinder on which people can see and go through the account of others who are going to the same concert as them and if both persons save each other’s account they get put in a chat together  to have the chance to talk to meet each other and maybe meet up at said concert. Before they see the accounts of other people, the app provides a map of the Netherlands so that people can see which concerts are coming up. When they register for one concert only then they can see the accounts of the people who are also going. If someone shows interest in another person and vice versa, only then a chat room will be created to start talking. For each concert you can have multiple chats and even combine them to create a bigger group! 
  We know that Amplify is a solution for the problem that the Hard Rock community faces. After doing some in-depth interviews almost all of the interviewees said they would like to be engaged or more engaged within the Hard Rock community and that going to concerts is most fun with others, who can be hard to find besides people they already know. Amplify wants the Hard Rock community to be more engaging by using the concert experience as its main selling point.
          </li> </ul>
          <p>Key Metrics:</p>  
          <ul>   
          <li>The amount of accounts: If  we know the amount of accounts registered in our app we have an idea if the app has enough users to run and if it is or can be successful.</li>   
          <li>The amount of chats that are created: Although we are not going to read what has been said in the chats, to know the amount of chats that have been created, we can get an insight if our main goal for the app is being met: connecting Hard Rock fans with each other. We can also see how many people directly interact with the app besides only making an account.
          </li>
          <li>The amount of people that signed up for a concert: With the knowledge about how many people register for a concert, we can have an idea what kind of concerts get the most attention and again, we see how many people directly interact with the app besides only making an account.</li>
          <li>The amount of website visitors: If we know how many people visit the website, not only the people making an account, we can get an idea of how easy we are to find and we can determine the ratio between people who make an account and who do not.</li>
          <li>The amount of Instagram interactions: Because Instagram is our most important communication and promotion channel, the likes, comments, followers etc. gives a good indication if we are doing good.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Costs:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Fixed Costs: To create an app we need to have at least a computer and an app builder on it, otherwise we cannot make anything. Furthermore, we need a workplace to work on it, which will cost some rent. We also need to have salaries for the people we hire to help us with building and producing the app.</li>
          <li>Variable Costs: An app has multiple prototypes that need to be tested, and every test can differ in the amount of money it costs. Furthermore, the app also needs advertising on multiple platforms to attract possible customers.
          </li>
          <li>Costs per Unit: The Average costs of our startup app starts at 30.000 dollars which is 27.615 euros
            The amount of users differs a lot between only 10 all up to somewhere in the early 2000, so we estimated that 1000 users would be a good starting point for our app, as this is something new entirely that has not been done.
            Costs per Unit: 27.615  : 1000 users = 27,62 euros
            </li></ul>
            <p>Unique Value Proposition:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>If we must summarize our unique value proposition in only 1 sentence than it would be: ‘The only app primarily focused on hard rock fans by bringing them together by the power of concerts and music.’</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unfair Advantage:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Reasoning Unfair Advantage 1:
              Other brands can copy our ideas, but they will never be the first and while they are starting we are already further.
              </li>
              <li>Reasoning Unfair Advantage 2:
                Every community is different from each other, so the ones that are made via our brand cannot be copied.
                </li>
                <li>Reasoning Unfair Advantage 3:
                  Our brand creates new connections and maybe even better new friendships. All of the friendships that are created with our brand started with our app and not with any other.
                  </li>
                  <li>Reasoning Unfair Advantage 4:
                    Besides creating communities and friendships, the memories that we create with our users can, just like the communities and friendships, be traced back to our app and not to another.
                    </li></ul>
                    <p>Channels:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Main Distribution Channels:
                      The app can be downloaded on the Play/App store of any phone, because that is an easy way for people to download and a lot of people already use them. Our website can also be linked to the Play/App store to direct people to it.     
                      </li>
                      <li>Main Communication Channels:
                        Our website and Instagram account are the most important main communication channels. Our website serves as a place where people can find more general information about the app and the team behind it. We use our Instagram mostly for interaction with the customers. We choose Instagram, because it is the most popular within our target group of 18-30 year olds. Our Instagram account is also our most important promotion channel to market the app itself. On the Amplify app we can share updates and important information directly to the users.
                        </li></ul>
                        <p>Customer Segments:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Our brand is targeted towards every Hard Rock fan between the ages of 18-30, because our insights come from that age gap.

                          Of course the people that we cater to are fans of Hard Rock in general and who love to go to concerts, but they need to have an appreciation of all kinds of music and the discovery of new kinds. For our app to work people need to like or love to go to concerts, otherwise it does not fit with them. If they also have an appreciation for music in general, the way of connecting with others might be easier and it can start some interesting conversations, which they thought they never would have. 
                          
                          Hard Rock is a genre that has a large amount of sub-genres within it. It is not as black and white as it seems. Therefore Amplify also looks in the sub-genres of Hard Rock. The bands we gave as examples don’t only can be seen as Hard Rock artists, but some of them also play a sub-genre or are derived from Hard Rock, such as Nirvana’s Grunge Rock and Metallica’s Metal. 
                          </li>
                          <li>Important Characteristics: We chose to have these characteristics, because we think that to really enjoy the app people need to have at least a few of these characteristics. The app is an adventure for which you cannot predict the outcome.
                          </li>
                          <li>Pain Points: We chose these pain points, because we think that the app can solve almost or not all of these problems, or at least help people to face them. In the end, it is all about how people decide to use the app. We provide the help, not the outcome.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Revenue:</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li>Revenue Models: A lot of apps are free to use, so we do not want people to pay to use our app. The ways we make money is by using: 1. A freemium model: although you do not have to pay for a lot of apps, a lot of them keep some features behind a paywall; 2. Advertising: we will provide spaces within the app for companies to put their advertisements; 3. Data: by sharing data with other (like-minded) companies we can improve our revenue.</li>
                          <li>Revenue Streams: For the revenue streams we use the first year to determine the revenue. Because we are a starting company, we think we get at best the lowest amount of revenue from each revenue model. 9,18 euros is one of the lowest daily revenue a company can get per day. 9,18 euros times 365 is 3350,70 euros. When comparing the premium options of social media we came to the conclusion that 60 euros a year for our premium function would be fair. Together with the estimated 1000 users this will gain a revenue of 15.000 euros, because around 4 percent of the app-users will buy the premium version. Finally, the revenue of a company can have an 8 percent increase when working with big data. </li>
                          <li>Gross Margin: When taking the costs and revenue into account and that we are looking at our first year of operation, we assume that we will have a loss. The estimated gross margin is calculated as followed:
                            (9,18 x 365) + (250 x 60) = 18.350,70 : 100 x 108 = 19.818,76 – 27.615 = -7.796,24 euros
                            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <h4><b>Validation of Assumptions</b></h4>
          <h4><i>Problem Interviews:</i></h4>
          <p>To determine the right problem to fix with our product, we conducted 10 problem interviews with Hard Rock fans. Within the interviews we concluded the following problems/insights:</p>
          <p>1. Problem Interviews Atina:</p>
          <p>Interview with Nikoloz:          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>He used to be harassed for being a metal head.
          </li>
          <li>He thinks the community could improve by not caring about what other people listen to. Because sometimes the community is not united because there's so many different genres of rock And everyone thinks their genre is better.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Interview with Pavel:
          </p>

          </li>
          <li>He feels that new bands lack variety.</li>
          <li>He is not engaged in the community, but he would like to be in. He wants to go to more concerts and events.</li>

          <li>He wants to do more around Rock with his friends, but does not know what.
          </li>
          <li>He would like to meet more people within the Rock community, which is hard for him.
          </li>
          <li>He loves to meet and engage with people through music. He would find it fun to learn an instrument together with others.
          </li>
          <li>He has a problem finding new music. He tends to hate his playlist, because he listens so much to it.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Interview with Emil:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>He does not like when people judge each other for the music they pick or like.</li>
          <li>He sometimes goes to concerts alone to meet people there. He makes friends and connects with people at concerts. When he goes to concerts with friends he builds a deeper connection with them.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>3. Problem Interviews Caroll-Ann            :</p>
          <p>Interview Felix:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>He wants to find his way deeper into Rock, because there is more for him to discover regarding it.</li>
          <li>He is not as engaged within the Rock community as he would like to be.
          </li>
          <li>He thinks there are sometimes limitations between the connection of artists and their fans.</li>
          <li>He purposely never goes to a concert alone.
          </li>
          <li>A lot of concerts are not cheap.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Interview Jaap:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>He says that there is not a lot of connection during a concert between the concert-goers, and only really with the people you were going to go there in the first place.</li>
          <li>He believes that there is a lot of misogyny in the Rock scene. There are a lot of old people who believe that their generation of Rock music is the best and they only criticise the newer generations of Rock.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>4. Problem Interviews Lars:</p>
          <p>Interview Nils:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>He never goes to a concert alone, because he prefers to go with others.</li>
          <li>He thinks concerts and festivals which take place in the heat should focus more on easy to access sources of water.</li>
          <li>He does not like how some people put music in certain boxes, when they decide what is and isn’t Rock. There is a lot of gatekeeping</li>
          <li>He is not at all engaged with the Hard Rock community, because he is very busy. He wants to interact more with people who enjoy the same music.</li>
          <li>He bought to much concert merchandise to a point it did not fit in his closet anymore
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Interview Wouter:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>He is not as engaged within the community as he would like to be.
          </li>
          <li>He feels that (some) people within the community can unfairly judge the artis</li>
          <li>He wishes to be more social at concerts.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Value Proposition and Business Plan:</h4>
           <p>After we conducted the problem interviews we began to look for the problems or the insights that the interviews or a lot of the interviews share with each other. We noticed that a lot of the interviewees wanted to be more connected with the people within the (Hard) Rock community and that most of them enjoy going to concerts, especially when they can share the experience of concerts with others.
          </p>
            <br>
            <p>We decided that we can combine the urge for more connection within the community, the love for concerts and wanting to experience concerts with others in 1 product: Amplify, the solution seen on the second and third lean canvas. We created an app on which people can find other people to go to a concert with. We want for people to seek and find like-minded Hard Rock fans and make connections while enjoying a concert. With Amplify we amplify the experience. Because all our interviews were with people who are from (early) Gen Z, we decided to focus Amplify on Hard Rock fans between 18-30 years old.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>With Amplify there is also a possibility for people to discover or take interest in new music and artists, because you can see all Hard Rock concerts on 1 platform. Maybe people will go out of their comfort zone, and this can help going against the overarching problems of not knowing where to find other music and artists and the judgement within the community. But, at its core Amplify is an app to connect Hard Rock fans through concerts. If we can help tackle the other problems, that would be a nice bonus.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It is interesting to notice that the solutions we proposed in the first lean canvas came back in Amplify and that it is something that Hard Rock fans really have a problem with. The problems we thought of in the first lean canvas are real problems we saw in the problem interviews, especially the problem of wanting to meet more people in the Hard Rock community. Not knowing when concerts are was not a big problem we noticed, but concerts were said to be events to connect. Furthermore, the target audience described in the first lean canvas works really well with Amplify. We saw the descriptions from the target audience back in our interviewees. The reason that we already had a good knowledge of the Hard Rock community is because some members in the group are Hard Rock fans and they already know a bit about the community. Because of this knowledge we  had a strong start from the beginning. In the end, we think that combining the first 2 solutions we thought of in the first lean canvas would be perfect for Hard Rock fans. The solutions combined were: ‘Creating a social media channel in which Hard Rock fans can chat one-on-one or in groups’, and ‘Creating an app to see when there are Hard Rock concerts in your designated area.’ Combining these 2 solutions will especially  tackle the problem of wanting to connect more with fellow Hard Rock fans, but not knowing where to start. And thus: Amplify has been born. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Existing Alternatives:</b></h4>
            <p>As mentioned in the lean canvases, there are some alternatives people can use instead of Amplify:</p>
            <p>Social Media</p>
            <p>Social media is the perfect place for people to meet and create communities for every kind of topic. In our interviews the social media platforms that got mentioned the most were: Discord, Reddit and Instagram. Discord is a video, voice, and chat platform to use for every kind of community. Reddit is a platform on which communities can share pictures, texts, or videos with each other. Instagram is a platform to share videos and photos with your followers.</p>
            <p>Tinder Festival Mode</p>
            <p>Tinder is a dating app used for people to find dates or even their next partner on. Tinder also has a feature called Tinder Festival Mode. This mode matches people who are going to the same festival or love live music</p>
            <p>Appic and Songkick</p>
            <p>Appic is an app used to find clubs, parties, and festivals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Songkick is similar, but it is an app to find concerts of Warner Music Group.</p>
            <p>Although these alternatives all can be used by Hard Rock fans, they are not focused on connecting Hard Rock fans, Hard Rock concerts or even Hard Rock in general. They do not cater to the Hard Rock audience just like Amplify does.</p>
            <h4>Solution Interviews:</h4>
            <p>After we made the prototype for our app (which can be seen in the appendix) we interviewed Hard Rock fans within our target age to see what they think about Amplify. Overall, every interviewee said that the app solves the problem of not knowing how to meet other Hard Rock fans, while wanting to. All of the interviewees also said that this was an app they would use or at least try out. After hearing this from our interviews, we came to the conclusion that this is a product worth persevering with. 

              Of course they also had some feedback regarding how the app looks and works. The app was overall pretty clear, but we should focus a bit more on the UX parts: the way chats are made can be a bit better, regarding your preferences of the amount of people you want to go to a concert with, the chat function should also make it easier for your real-life friends to join in, and the lack of a go back button is annoying. Multiple people said that they liked the Tinder aspect of the app, but one interviewee said that the app feels a bit too much like Tinder for his liking. He gets the feeling that it is more like a dating app. So the part where you swipe for people can be a bit different and it would be nice, another interviewee said, if you see more information about the people besides their music preferences. The overall insights per interview are as follows:

              <p>Interview with Stelian :
              </p>
              <ul>
              <li>He would like to see which people are going to the concert, instead of connecting to them on the app.
              </li>
              <li>He would use this app, because it is easy to use. Also because it is free, he would have it just in case. With these apps you never know when it will become popular. It would be an advantage for every Hard Rock fan to have.
              </li>
              <li>He sees the app as a way for people to get together and to have fun, instead for people to really connect. He does think it is not really targeted that way.
              </li>
              <li>He likes that there are different settings for different preferences and people.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks additionally it would be nice if you could use the app to buy group tickets and add the people to the chat instantly.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks people will be pleasantly surprised with all the features in the app.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks the app solves the problem. 
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Interview with Preslav:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>It would be cool to expand to neighbouring countries, like Belgium and Germany. There are also a lot of concerts and Hard Rock fans there.
              </li>
              <li>It would be cool to show upcoming tickets.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks the chat feature is really nice, and works well if you chat with a group. He would like it if there is a group chat option.
              </li>
              <li>He likes that the match and rock feature looks a lot like Tinder. He also likes that you can see the bio and profile of the people on the app. He thinks these features make it easy to find people.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks having a map on which you can see and pick concerts is a nice feature and something he probably has never seen before. For him it is more natural to use the map, instead of the search bar, which takes more time, according to him.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks the app solves the problems Hard Rock fans face. 
              </li>
              <li>He likes the colour palette that is used for the app.
              </li>
              <li>He thinks the app's interface is pretty simple and straightforward. He finds it easy to navigate through the buttons and the menu. According to him the app works really naturally. He says it does not take a lot of time to understand how the app works.

              <p><i>Solution Interviews Ana:</i></p>
              <p>Soultion Interview with Andrei:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>He liked the map view as a feature the most. He finds it very interesting and interactive. He thinks he never found this feature on another app.
                -He loves that he can choose his own dates and that he does not have to scroll through the dates when the concerts are taking place and that he has to see for himself if he can or cannot go.
                -He misses a go back button in the beginning.
                -He finds the feature to meet people cool, but he would like to know a bit more about themselves
                -He would use the app to try it out.
                -He likes that the app is only for a specific target audience being Hard Rock fans.
                </li>
              </ul>
                <p>Interview with Alexandra:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>She really likes the features, like seeing upcoming concerts and especially the match and rock features. 
                  -She thinks that the choose your favourite band and the how do you like to rock out part works better if you ask those after creating your account, because she thinks it is a bit confusing in the beginning. 
                  -She misses a go back button.
                  -She doesn't know what the main screen would look like, because now we only show the app when you open it for the first time.
                  -It was not clear for her what happens if you click that you do not know for sure if you go to a concert.
                  -It is not clear what the lighting bolt means in the navigation bar
                  -Overall, she likes the idea, but there are small details that do not make sense when you first use the app, but learn how to use as you use the features more.
                  She thinks the app would solve the problem. It is easy to find people. It is also very interactive, which does not make the app boring.

                  <p>Interview Diego:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>He likes the idea of the app and said they would use it as a rock fan to find concert buddies.
                    He suggests including users' favourite songs of the band playing in their profile, not just general favourites.
                    He proposes using pictures of bands instead of text for certain elements,  like what Spotify does.
                    He likes that it is able to select favourite songs and artists on profiles.
                    He said that although hard rock is niche, fans would use an app focused on that genre.

                    <p>Interview with Laura:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>She thinks the app serves as a solution to the problem.
                      She likes the questions at the beginning of the app to set up your account.
                      She likes the Tinder-like matching feature, because she can choose for herself who she goes to a concert with, instead of  an algorithm deciding for her.
                      She finds the map view very cool and interactive, because you can just decide which city you want to go to and you can see more cities you did not think of before.
                      She finds the chat feature very nice, because it gives you the opportunity to connect with people before you go to a concert together.
                      She would use the app. It is easy to use and straightforward. She likes the fact of the chat option, because she would go to concerts with strangers only if she could talk to them beforehand.
                      She suggests putting a call or facetime feature in the chat function, for safety purposes if you want to see the person to know if they are real. Some type of verification before you make an account would be very helpful.
                      To keep people from going to other social media, she suggests to leave social media from the profile.

                    <p>Solution Interview Lars</p>
                    <p>Interview with Laurens:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>He thinks that the app solves the problem, because it is clearly designed to connect people. And as a side thing you can find concerts.
                      He thinks the chat function is the best feature, because you can chat with multiple people. It is good to chat with people before you go to concerts with them.
                      He would say the specific set up to find people needs improvement, and to be more specific the match and rock feature. It feels a bit more like Tinder, so he sees the app more as a dating app. Besides that, he does not know how the match and rock question and match and rock feature work with each other if you want to go with more than 1 person to a concert.
                      Because the app feels like a dating app now, he would use it if he was single.

                      <p>Interview with Eliza:</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>She thinks the app could fix the problem.
                        She likes that we include that someone can choose how many people they want to go with to a concert (the how do you like to rock out section). But the lay-out of that section needs to be more defined. The numbers on there need to specify that it is about people, because she was a bit confused at first.
                        It is confusing where to find and make your own profile.
                        Personally she would like to already be in a group chat instead of one to one, because she is pretty shy and would not start talking. She wouldn’t use the chat function, because it is high maintenance to talk to a lot of people and would rather join a group.
                        If you could add your own friends, she would use the app. She would be more comfortable using the app if she could add her own friends in the chat.
