                  <em>•	Red is a strong hue that frequently connotes intensity, emotion, and energy—elements that are in perfect harmony with the essence of hard rock music. Red can arouse in fans the intense emotion and energy associated with the genre. Because it draws the eye, this color is appropriate for a company that wishes to come across as daring and memorable.

                  #00406B
                  <em>•	Since dark grey is a strong and authoritative color, it could be interpreted as a representation of the firm foundation hard rock music has had throughout music history. Because of its versatility, it can be used to ground branding while allowing for an edge that is very much in keeping with hard rock aesthetics. It may also be readily matched with more brilliant hues. Moreover, dark grey gives the possibility to have a bolder design, making space for bolder colors such as red and yellow. As the genre of rock is always displayed within the colors of strong red and grey or black, this color palette is suitable for Amplify as a brand and for its target audience. &hellip;</em>

                  <em>•	Yellow is used as an accent color to offer an intense touch that draws attention without overpowering the main color scheme. Yellow can stand for the strong energy and bursts of excitement that are connected to electric guitar solos and live performances in the hard rock genre. It's a color that, with its brightness, can energize a brand identity and inspire passion.&hellip;</em>

                  <em>•	A sense of mystery and intricacy can be conveyed by Purple, which is evocative of the depth and occasionally the cryptic or gloomy lyrics present in hard rock music. Due to its historical associations with monarchy and wealth, this hue may lend the brand an air of exclusivity and appeal to fans who value their musical preferences highly and regard them as essential components of who they are. In combination with yellow, being a vibrant, bright, and warm color, using it as an accent against purple produces a striking contrast.&hellip;</em>

          <p>Amplify is a brand that strives to connect rock fans through concerts and amplify their experience. We are a service that offers rock fans the chance to connect with other rock fans alike them and go to concerts around The Netherlands. From the conducted interviews with our target audience we found out that:
            <li>rock fans don’t have people to go to concerts with</li>
            <li>It is hard for rock fans to find people to go to concerts with and they don’t know where to look</li>
            <li>They want to meet new people in general</li>
            <li>They want to have new experiences </li>
            </p>
            <h5 class="em-spacing1">Social Media choice</h5>
            <p>Target audience is  hard rock fans aged between 18-28, who are casual listeners and open to listen to different sub-genres of rock.  Instagram is the most used platform by people aged 18-34. They make up 61 % of all Instagram users (Zote,2024). From the conducted interviews all 8 of our interviewees use Instagram as their preferred platform. Some of them use Reddit and just 1 has Facebook,  which he hasn’t opened in months , so we decided not to focus on Facebook and choose only Instagram.
            </p>
            <h5 class="em-spacing1">Objectives</h5>
            <h6 class="em-spacing">1. Reach</h6>
            <li>Reach 500 accounts through “accounts reached” by March 31st, 2024.
              -When individuals encounter a brand for the first time, they already have an idea of the brand visibility, reputation, and its message (Edelman, 2023). Therefore, trust is necessary. In this context, 500 accounts reached will give the confidence to other individuals to trust and visit the social media page.
              </li>
              <li>An average watch time of 4 seconds per reel by March 31st, 2024
                -The average watch time of Instagram reels is 3-4 seconds( Temples,2024)
                </li>
                <li>Average of 250 views per reel shared on Instagram by March 31st, 2024
                  -The most reached followers per reel for an account up to 500 followers was 288 in 2023, so we think it would be realistic to say that we want to have an average of 250 views per shared reel.
                 </li>
            <h6 class="em-spacing">2. Affect</h6> 
            <li>We want our audience to feel excited and engaged by March 31st, through engagement in posts by turning on countdown reminders and notifications, interacting on polls, quiz, questions and direct messages.
            </li>
            <li>Social media engagement is found to have a great impact on small businesses affecting especially the customer loyalty (Read, 2020).Research also found that 63% of consumers agree that their loyalty to a brand is influenced by the quality of customer service provided on social media (Social media’s role, n.d.)
            </li>
            <h6 class="em-spacing">3. Advocacy response </h6>
            <li class="bold-marketing">Have at least one share per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.</li>
            <p>If people share the social media content that the brand is creating it can start a sense of trust and quality, because people sometimes see popular content as investigated and approved by others (Agency Analytics, n.d.)</p>
            <li class="bold-marketing">Reach a minimum of 1 comment on each Instagram post by March 31st, 2024.
            </li>
           <p>Furthermore, a research conducted with 123,410 Instagram profiles shows that profiles with up to 1000 followers only get 1 comment per post maximum on a day (Bieldfeldt, 2021).
          </p>
          <li class="bold-marketing">Hit at least 10 to 15 likes per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.
          </li>
          <p>The aforementioned research conducted by Bielfeldt (2021) and Erxleben (2021) both mention that small Instagram accounts up to 1000 followers get a max of 5 likes per day.
          </p>
          <li class="bold-marketing">Have 20 clicks of the link in our bio by March 31st
          </li>
          <p>The link in the bio will be used to send the audience to the website and therefore  they will be directed to more business focused content which increases brand presence (Fuhrmann Creative; LLC, 2023, August 23).
          </p>
          <h5 class="em-spacing1">Campaign</h5>
          <p class="bold-marketing">For our media campaign we use Instagram as a social media platform to promote the brand. </p>
          <li>We introduced our brand, shared our values and vision in a post. To help  us achieve our Affect objective, because it made our audience feel excited about our brand, create a sense of loyalty. Sharing our values also help us attract customers that share the same values.
          </li>
          <li>Countdown stories - to achieve our Affect objective, because audience will feel engaged by turning on countdowns for our launches
          </li>
          <li>Reels - we shared behind the scenes reels to achieve our Reach objectives. We also shared our reels on stories with interactive questions about them so the audience can engage with them more.We also introduced our team in individual reels for each person. 
          </li>
          <li>Posts with information about our service and our app. These posts help us build trust in our brand, build excitement as well. They promote our brand and our service.We shared main features of the app to keep the audience engaged for the launch of the product. We also shared these posts in stories for further engagement and word of mouth recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>For all posts and reels we used detailed and longer captions to keep the attention of the viewer to help with engagement. We also added hashtags to all posts and reels to make them more discoverable. 
          </li>

            </p>
            <li class="bold-marketing">Remade content calendar:</li>
            <p>This is how our content calendar looks after the changes in time for posting and some new content ideas. We also spread out the reels posting to ensure more engagement. We added more posts that share information about our website and about our app to help promote our brand. We also added more stories with interactive polls and questions to make our audience engage more with our brand.</p>
          
            <h4 id="marketing-2" class="heading-corporate-1 em-spacing1">Learning Points</h4>
            <p class="bold-marketing em-spacing1">Reach
            </p>
            <li>Reach 500 accounts through “accounts reached” by March 31st, 2024.- We reached this objective, even exceeded with almost a 1000 more accounts. We didn’t expect to achieve this objective, we actually thought that 500 accounts is too much to reach in 4 weeks.
            </li>
            <li>An average watch time of 4 seconds per reel by March 31st, 2024- All of our reels are 5 seconds or longer, so we thought that 4 seconds average watch time would be achievable, because most people don’t watch reels until the end. We managed to achieve this objective for 4 out of 5 reels. We didn’t reach this objective on our most watched reel (1451 views), so we think that this reel had a strong hook, but could not captivate the attention of the viewers for any longer, so the reel is lacking something in the middle- adding more value, element of a surprise, call to action or highlight the benefit of watching until the end. 
            </li>
            <li>Average of 250 views per reel shared on Instagram by March 31st, 2024- During the first two weeks we had posted three reels all with under 200 views. We thought that we would not reach this objective during the last two weeks. But then one of the reels gained over a 1000 views, therefore all other reels also received engagement and went over 250 views. This was also the reel with the strongest hook, so we learned that reels with stronger hooks and longer captions receive more views. FFor this reel we also used a trendy instagram sound which we think is key for the engagement on this reel. 
            </li>
            <p class="bold-marketing em-spacing1">Affect
            </p>
            <li>We want our audience to feel excited and engaged by March 31st, through engagement in posts by turning on countdown reminders and notifications, interacting on polls, quiz, questions and direct messages. - We believe that for 4 weeks we have built a small but strong community that believes in our brand. We posted a lot of stories with interactive polls, questions and our followers were very active on those polls. We also received a few direct messages and we tried to respond in less than an hour. In those direct messages we also received positive feedback on the look of our feed and our values as well, which we believe shows that we have built some sense of trust and loyalty in our followers. We learned that interactive stories are a great way to interact with our followers and to open discussions in direct messages so we will continue to make them and more often.
            </li>
            <p class="bold-marketing em-spacing1">Advocacy response
            </p>
            <li>Have at least one share per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.- We managed to reach this objective, all of our posts have been shared once by different people on their stories. Even though we reached this objective, we were hoping for more shares. We learned that longer captions with more value and information will be more beneficial for people to spread the word for our reels, so they share this information with others.
            </li>
            <li>Reach a minimum of 1 comment on each Instagram post by March 31st, 2024.- We reached this objective on a few of our posts. We were expecting to reach it and even exceed it. We learned that a call to action in the caption, or adding a question in the caption that viewers can answer in the comments and start a discussion, will bring us more comments on our posts.</li>
            <li>Hit at least 10 to 15 likes per post on Instagram by March 31st, 2024.- We managed to reach this objective as expected. We learned that building trust and loyalty in our audience builds a stronger community , therefore consistency in our engagement on posts and reels.
            </li>
            <li>Have 20 clicks of the link in our bio by March 31st- We almost reached this objective. We believe that we didn’t reach it because we shared the link to our website too late. We also could have posted it on our stories with a call to action to view our website to receive more traffic.
            </li>
            <p class="em-spacing1"> <i>Overall we learned that a well made and prepared Content calendar is the key to a successful campaign. We managed to post everything planned in the Content calendar, because with it you can see what you have to prepare for next week. It removed the stress from creating the content last minute or forgetting to post. Midway during our campaign we scheduled our content on Instagram so we got a reminder every time, you just click and post, this also helped to not forget to post. This was especially helpful to post at exactly 6pm, because this is the time we received the most engagement, after testing other posting times. We learned that reels should have strong hooks and some element of value or surprise in the middle to keep the viewer’s attention until the end. We learned that asking questions in the captions of our reels and posts will help open discussions in the comments. We received the most engagement with our profile through reels, so we learned that we should focus on them. We also learned that interactive stories are very helpful with interacting with our audience, which builds trust and loyalty. </i></p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="heading-corporate-1">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we continue the campaign in the future, we will first set new objectives, so that we have clear goals and the content we make aims to reach those objectives. We will also make a new Content calendar, because it helped  us a lot during those four weeks. It removed the stress from forgetting when to post and what to post, brainstorming and planning the content ahead helped us save more time on thinking during the campaign and gave us time to interact with our audience and be more active on stories. In the future we will focus on reels, because they brought the most traffic to our page, but we will use more trendy instagram sounds so they reach more people. We will also make reels have strong hooks and more information both in the video and in the caption, because our best performing reel had both of those. For posts we will add questions that the audience can answer in the comments for further engagement and start discussions. We will post more stories with interactive questions, polls. We want to interact more with our audience so we build trust and loyalty. In the future we would also want to have posts or reels in collaboration with influencers or hard rock bands for some giveaway.  We found that giveaways bring a lot of engagement to profiles. We posted our website link too late and with no previous announcement so in the future, when there are new changes in our website or app, we will notify the audience that changes will be made or that there will be new announcements( like the giveaways) so we build anticipation in our audience and further engagement.</p>

We also add a lighting bolt which is a symbol of our brand (also in the logo) and a guitar to also amplify that our brand is connected to rock. We used a different font from the one on our website, because this is more readable when the background is one of our bright colors, it is also more bold.</p>
